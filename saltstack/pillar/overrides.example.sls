# Required: replace with the Vault root_token given during the Vault
# setup process (see 'Starting up Vault' section of README)
vault token: "[[insert vault root token value here]]"

# Optional: custom cluster domain name - for example - rather than using the
# default 'devcluster', you can provide your own so you can access cluster 
# services on [service-name].service.[custom domain].
#cluster domain: "[[custom domain]]"
